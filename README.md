# <img src="src/img/icon48.png" align="absmiddle"> Chrome Extension - Read Later

When I am learning something, I tend to open a lot of tabs. Some of the tabs are useful but I sometimes want to read them later. Therefore, to help myself and to practice, I am developing this "Read Later" Chrome Extension.

As I am very new to Chrome Extension development and JavaScript, it may contain many unoptimised code. If you have any suggestions or find any problems using the extension, please [submit a bug or a feature request](https://github.com/lx223/read-later/issues/).

### Installation

3. Click on the <kbd>Load unpacked extension...</kbd> button, browse to the unarchived directory of the downloaded release and confirm
