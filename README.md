# Chrome Extension - Read Later

When I am learning something, I tend to open a lot of tabs. Some of the tabs are useful but I sometimes want to read them later. Therefore, to help myself and to practice, I am developing this "Read Later" Chrome Extension.

As I am very new to Chrome Extension development and JavaScript, it may contain many unoptimised code. If you have any suggestions or find any problems using the extension, please [submit a bug or a feature request](https://github.com/lx223/read-later/issues/).

### Installation

1. **[Download ZIP](https://github.com/lx223/read-later/archive/master.zip)** and unarchive to wherever you prefer
2. Using **Google Chrome** browser, navigate to chrome://extensions/ and enable "Developer mode" in the upper right corner
3. Click on the <kbd>Load unpacked extension...</kbd> button, browse to the unarchived directory of the downloaded release and confirm.
